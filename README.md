# KX3-SMD-Tuning-Knob
Remote tuning knob/switches for Elecraft KX3/KX2
External Tuning Knob/Buttons for the Elecraft KX3/KX2 transceiver de WB2ART

It is about the same size, 95x75x25mm as the elecraft KPod, and uses (mostly) surface-mount devices. The encoder, led's, rocker switch, and  a few headers are thru-hole.

It uses the same optical encoder (with a shorter shaft) as the original tuning knob.
Tactile switches are used to activate the functions. Each button can be programmed for tap and hold functions.
