# KX3-SMD-Tuning-Knob
Remote tuning knob/switches for Elecraft KX3/KX2
External Tuning Knob/Switches for the Elecraft KX3/KX2 transceiver de WB2ART

It is about the same size, 95x75x25mm as the elecraft KPod, and uses surface-mount devices. The encoder, led's, rocker switch, crystal and  a few headers are thru-hole. The tactile switches are mounted on the front of the pcb. The encoder is mounted on the rear of the pcb with the shaft protruding through the front of the pcb. The led's are soldered to the rear of the pcb, and are on the front of the pcb. All other components are mounted on the rear of the pcb, including all external connections. The rocker switch is connected to the ocb through a short wire to a 3-pin female header and mates with a 3-pin male header.

It uses the same optical encoder (with a shorter shaft) as the original tuning knob.
Tactile switches are used to activate the functions. Each button can be programmed for tap and hold functions.

A case, buttons for the tactile switches, and a spacer for the rocker switch have been designed (Fusion 360). I am still working on the rear cover, and stand.
